# Angular Momentum Reaction Engine : 

#### The Data Cartography Tools are available to download within XLS format. [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHGtmfjIICpuETvXsRd2eww/playlists)

The statistical modelling tools for 'Data' are defined within a framework of both 'Multi-Variable' and ‘ Single Variable Calculus'. 
And charted to visualise the mapping of coordinates. 

#### Note : When creating projections within Lambda.

The field equations define ENERGY_AS_A_UNIT. And determine ‘Reaction complexes’. This denotes energetic conversions towards either a single or multivariable frame of reference.
Wave function instabilities often arise within Lambda propagation, at what is called 'wave 6'. Due to field inversions which can be termed as 'Attenuation'. It becomes a representation of the compounding of relativistic effects. And these aspects are incorporated into the calculation sheets.

### Infinities.

#### Approaching Infinity

* If we move away from the idea of 'Infinity' being an ethereal aspect. And instead understand it as an attribute of something. 
We can begin to use infinitie, as a 'calculation complex'. The attributes created within the 'Infinities folder' are functions of 'Negative and Positive' Power ratios, which can  be assigned to Lambda based equations.

#### There are two formats within the infinities folder, which encode a topological description of energetic distribution. 

- Infinities_Transport : Is an example of infinity when it becomes assigned. In terminology this implies that infinity will draw to a close when a certain condition is met.
Infinities_transport, assigns electron transport as a key function to energetic distribution. And therefore create energetic loss/gain vectors within that movement. 

#### Infinities_Transport : Ratio's

* Single Variable : ((1.5578/0.102414319819447)*0.05)
* Multi Variable : ((1.5578*0.102414319819447)/0.95)

* Recall this is an aspect which includes the assignment of electron transportation, we must show how that variance is assembled. And how the structural transformation looks, within a sequence.

#### Inifinities_Continuous 

* Encapsulates the context of infinity frozen in time, let's imagine. There are no loss/gain vectors within the energetic distribution. And instead just a description of the nuclear ratios which are to be assigned. In order to approach infinity.

#### The Base Power Ratios : Created within Infinities

Describe the relationship between nuclear resonance and mathematics. And this enables us to establish procedural methods when aiming to discern the trajectories of ENERGY_AS_A_UNIT. The primary base power used within the Lambda equations presented incorporates the ratio (^1.14). As statistically when calculated against the average, will give the most precise forecast within a designated framework. 

* (^1.14)
* (^1.15)
* (^1.16)
* (^1.17)
* (^1.18)

These ratios can also be incorporated into other statistical tools, which are provided.

### Lambda_Sequencer_in_Multiplication : Base Equation.

Using the 'Nuclear Ratio' and therefore 'Base Power Ratio (^1.14)' 
Which is cross referenced within the following folder 

* Infinities 

The aim here is simplicity when in calculation, and precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

You will only require two values in order to calculate both :

* Amplitude
* Direction

### Boundary Momentum_Sequencer_In_Division : Unit_(Sequencing_Alternate_Divisional_Complex).

Deceptive in name, the toolset infers growth in division of an arbitrary SUM_VALUE_OF_ENERGY, 
between three equal ratios. And will as long as {DECIMALISATION} remains intact, much like a plant continues to refresh. 

This becomes therefore an important cross referencing tool. 
When handling higher VALUES_OF_ENERGY , as this is often the area which becomes De-Decimalised.

### Electrical Resistance : Unit_(AC)_Deposition_within_Decimalisation.

The equation depicts a {Probability of} a cancellation channel within 'Nuclear Resonance'. Which establishes the attenuation cycle. And this becomes an equation to experiment against. It is unclear whether the calculation holds within both MhZ Frequency Bands and AC Alternating Currents. Tho if accurate this would establish the redox potential within metallic structures, as well as calcification deposits within cellular organisms. 

* ( 0.0012000000000000000 - 0.0012500000000000000 ) = ( -0.0000500000000000001 )

* ( Redox Depiction ) = ( 0.0000000000000000001 )

### Unit_Currency (Differential_Inversions)

A tool useful for describing the current state of transaction potential, when transacting between two countries. 
It's very important to understand when using this tool, you are visualizing a vacuum potential. Which equates to attenuation within a particular spectrum.. 
The calculation sheet uses currency differentials to incorporate the variance within a Lambda field equation. To use the tool ;
