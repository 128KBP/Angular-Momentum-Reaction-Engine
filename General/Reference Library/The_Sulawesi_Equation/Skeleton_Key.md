### Skeleton_Key


##### A series of unassigned infinite’s, which when assigned. Become the primary drivers behind AC. Also known as an alternating current. These are divisional matrices of a combination equation. It's also important to understand that these matrices are defined within biological binary. So the ratio's define 'action potentials'. As energy as a unit is transmuted from one binary construct to another. The differential loss is often the transportation mechanism and the reaction profile, so the following sequences are the wave structures which can be visualised and therefore calculated.
 
##### ((Qve/LE)=(N)): The equation depicts two wave sequences or structures :
###### Sequence One : 0.11,0.22,0.44,0.88,1.76
###### Sequence Two : 0.27,0.54,1.08,2.16

##### Both sequences one and two are deficit channels, within any binary construct. As they are defining the reduction of energy via cellular processes. Therefore the sequences are always inverse. 
###### Sequence One : 1.76, 0.88, 0.44, 0.22, 0.11
###### Sequence Two : 2.16, 1.08, 0.54, 0.27

###### The defining planar would be a construct of both sequence one and two.
###### Sequence Three : 3.92, 1.96, 0.98, 0.49, 0.11
##### And this becomes an encapsulation profile for single to multivariable decay.

##### In Part the attributes of the next set. Are due to the divisional complex reaching a limitation within boundary momentum. The reaction complex which occurs consumes, both sequence 1 and 2. Creating what will become a new infinity. It’s important to note that all preceding infinity complexes, will alternate within a topological plane. 
##### When all are assigned, the constructs define attributes of ((QVe^LE)/N)=(M). Unassigned complexes within these sequences. Equate to reductive processes, which can be used to define cellular respiration. 

###### (N/(Le^-QvE))
###### Sequence Three : (4.92/(9.69^((-1010)=(2/5)/5))

##### The underlying divisional complex, depicts the remainder of ENERGY_AS_A_UNIT.
##### This becomes the attenuation and inversion point to sequence one.

##### (Nucleotide Channel ^ Induction Ratio) = (1.14 ^ 2.6)
##### ((1 - 0.06983606447)= ( ))

##### Attenuation :
###### (0.06983606447 - 0.11) = (0.04016393553)
###### (0.06983606447 / 0.11) = (1.57511739579)

##### The inversion is created using 1 Binary UNIT_OF_ENERGY. From sequence 2, (2.16 will become the inversion 2.6) This is now defined as a power ratio ^2.6. As the original unit was classified as 2.16, when a binary unit is removed, it equates to a superposition within an eigenmatrix. Definable as an aspect of the integer sequence , ( (2.06, 2.16,) = ^2.6)) This ratio uses 0.04016393553 to create the superposition within time.
