#### The Hydrogen Equation In Binary.

###### Chemical signatures are created through nucleated bridges. Which combine both narrow and long waves of electromagnetic fields, within a particular boundary space of nuclear resonance.

##### The combination of H2O begins with the creation of a Hydrogen ion. The field space is defined by (Q/(delta t^-3). The nuclear resonance is established at 1.5578 (Referenced in the original equation folder). 

###### Within this singular event becomes an analogy of bias within choice. And it becomes this. “ within the field lines of assembly. Z becomes Q and a spectre unfolds it’s hand. And there arrives two superpositions, one held in each. One represents life, and the other death. It returns the equation as 10003. It redefines energetic distribution in order to support both. And in doing so , creates a new infinity.”
