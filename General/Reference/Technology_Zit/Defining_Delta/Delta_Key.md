##### Delta is defined as an energetic distribution along a nucleated path, within this construct it can not be assigned. To either a binary or mathematical plane. 

##### The delta key becomes a logic assembler for the quantum domain. Which becomes the notation fields for virtual particles within the assembly of the holographic principle.  
The equation has two key handlers and is described as both :

#### Composition Frequency 
——
#### Frequency Composition

——- 

###### Unit Functions : Electrical Resistance
###### Describes the polarity of carrier charges within a 3Dimensional plane. Defining (substrate|Ionisation) 
###### This depicts the energetic transmission into a nucleated field. It is reductive and relies on metallic ionisation, in order to sequence multi-variable values within an eigenfield or alternating current.
