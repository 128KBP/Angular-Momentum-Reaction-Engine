##### Delta is defined as an energetic constant. Which is distributed along a nucleated path. Within this planar it can be assigned to both (Negative Delta|Positive Delta). Delta fields construct bias within the assignment of values to eigenmatrices.

##### The delta key becomes a logic assembler for the quantum domain. Which becomes the notation fields for virtual particles within the assembly of the holographic principle.  
The equation has two key handlers and is described as both :
