#### Lambda Field Signalling

##### The aim here is to establish the causal effects, within relativistic behaviours. 
##### Whereby an encoding channel is created within a Lambda Field, using wave variance to assign atomic assemblies of (Total System Energy).
##### And inturn guided over a squared constant, to be either positive or negative. This defines the vacuum field of Lambda to be either repulsive or attractive in nature.
