#### Lambda Field Signalling

##### The aim here is to establish the causal effects, within relativistic behaviours. Whereby an encoding channel is created within a Lambda Field. Using wave variance to assign atomic assemblies of (Total System Energy) and guided over a squared constant. To be either positive or negative. This defines the vacuum field of Lambda to be either repulsive or attractive in nature.
