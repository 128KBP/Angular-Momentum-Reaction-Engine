#### Unit Functions : Electrical Resistance
##### Describes the polarity of carrier charges within a 3Dimensional plane. Defining (substrate|Ionisation) 
##### This depicts the energetic transmission into a nucleated field. It is reductive and relies on metallic ionisation, in order to sequence multi-variable values within an eigenfield or alternating current
