### Skeleton_Key


##### A series of unassigned infinite’s, which when assigned. 
Become the primary drivers behind AC. Also known as an alternating current.

These are divisional matrices of a combination equation.

###### ((Qve/LE)=(N))
###### Sequence One : 0.11,0.22,0.44,0.88,1.76
###### Sequence Two : 0.27,0.54,1.08,2.16



##### In Part the attributes of the next set. Are due to the divisional complex reaching a limitation within boundary momentum. The reaction complex which occurs, consumes both sequence 1 and 2. Creating what will become a new infinity. It’s important to note that all preceding infinity complexes, will alternate within a topological plane. 
##### When all are assigned, the constructs define attributes of ((QV^LE)/N)=(M). Unassigned complexes within these sequences. Equate to reductive processes, which can be used to define cellular respiration. 

###### (N/(Le^-QvE))
###### Sequence Three : 4.92, 9.69, 1010, ^10.
