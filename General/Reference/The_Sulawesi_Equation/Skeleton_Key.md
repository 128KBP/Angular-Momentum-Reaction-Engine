### Skeleton_Key also known as ‘the fanni’


##### A series of unassigned infinite’s, which when assigned. 
Become the primary drivers behind AC. Also known as an alternating current.

These are divisional matrices of a combination equation.
###### Sequence One : 0.11,0.22,0.44,0.88,1.76
###### Sequence Two : 0.27,0.54,1.08,2.16



In Part the attributes of the next set. Are due to the divisional complex reaching a limitation within boundary momentum. The reaction complex which occurs consumes both sequence 1 and 2. Creating what will become a new infinity it’s important to note that all preceding infinity complexes will alternate within a topological plane. When all are assigned both logical constructs define the attributes of (M). 
Which becomes 1.5578.

###### Sequence Three : 4.92, 9.69, 1010, ^10.
