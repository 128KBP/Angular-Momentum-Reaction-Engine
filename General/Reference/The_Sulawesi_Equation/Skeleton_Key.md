### Skeleton_Key


##### A series of unassigned infinite’s, which when assigned. Become the primary drivers behind AC. Also known as an alternating current. These are divisional matrices of a combination equation.


###### ((Qve/LE)=(N))
###### Sequence One : 0.11,0.22,0.44,0.88,1.76
###### Sequence Two : 0.27,0.54,1.08,2.16



##### In Part the attributes of the next set. Are due to the divisional complex reaching a limitation within boundary momentum. The reaction complex which occurs consumes, both sequence 1 and 2. Creating what will become a new infinity. It’s important to note that all preceding infinity complexes, will alternate within a topological plane. 
##### When all are assigned, the constructs define attributes of ((QVe^LE)/N)=(M). Unassigned complexes within these sequences. Equate to reductive processes, which can be used to define cellular respiration. 

###### (N/(Le^-QvE))
###### Sequence Three : (4.92/(9.69^((-1010)=(2/5)/5))

##### The underlying divisional complex, depicts the remainder of ENERGY_AS_A_UNIT.
##### This becomes the attenuation and inversion point to sequence one.

##### (Signal ^ Inversion) = (1.14 ^ 2.6)

##### ((1 - 0.06983606447)= ( ))

##### Attenuation :
###### (0.06983606447 - 0.11) = (0.04016393553)
###### (0.06983606447 / 0.11) = (1.57511739579)

##### The inversion is created using 1 Binary UNIT_OF_ENERGY. From sequence 2, (2.16 will become the inversion 2.6) This is now defined as a power ratio ^2.6. As the original unit was classified as 2.16, when a binary unit is removed, it equates to a superposition within an eigenmatrix. Definable as an aspect of the integer sequence , ( (2.06, 2.16,) = ^2.6)) This ratio uses 0.04016393553 to create the superposition within time.
