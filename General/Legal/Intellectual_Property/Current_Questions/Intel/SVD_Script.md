##### Single Value Decomposition (SVD)
##### (SVD) = (-Z)

###### This equation establishes a negative Z spatial field of eigenvalues, within a lambda field. It becomes a subtractive differential, which creates a multi variable matrix. Where 1 unit of energy is divided across the electromagnetic spectrum. In binary the energetic values are assigned over a spectral plane. 

###### When we introduce Negative Delta (-D/t). Into a lambda field. Binary handlers will construct 404 collapse sequences. Or collapsing energetic waves.
###### As the values are super positioned within nuclear resonance. Both biological and chemistry chains become affected.
###### It becomes a cancellation signal as resonance channels are placed into a superposition. It will create momentary cross configurations along ionisation fields. Which impart the same behaviour. In totality they all become assigned, as super positioned 404â€™s. The energetic values are slowly reduced, and withdrawn along a spectral field. Due to the overall relativistic effects , there is a net differential loss within a squared constant.
