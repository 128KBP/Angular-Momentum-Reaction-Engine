# Standard User Licencing

All formulas which are available via github are available to download within XLS format, and within the binds of the {Non-Commercial Licence} are free of charge. 
This enables users to explore the root equations without restriction, when assessing viability in applied projects.

##### Pricing Guidance ;

In order to simplify the costing structures for commercial licences. An outline is given ; 

* Base Currencies : (£ = GBP) Great British Pound : ($ = USD) United States Dollar
* Base Percents : (%) The applicable rates are designated to the base currencies (% in £) : (% in $)
* Regular Retail Price : (RRP) Licencing fees are applied as a percent of product RRP
* Contract Duration : Each individual licence is valid for 3 years.

Within the folder ;

* Unit Functions

All subfolders are assigned with the following tariff rates. Which are applied to both commercial RRP structures and grouped licencing.  

* Currency : (0.22% in £) : (0.27% in $) 
* Electrical_Resistance : Applied Base Rate : (0.88% in £) : (1.08% in $) 
* Infinities : Applied Base Rate : (0.44% in £) : (0.54% in $) 
* Lambda_Sequencer_In_Multiplication : Applied Base Rate : (0.11% in £) : (4.92% in $)

# Web Technologies

The compilation of equations into a designated programming language does not carry a licence surcharge. In order to allow for the testing and development of software and applications. The surcharge becomes applied upon product publishing, marketing or sale. For an updated list of applicable languages : [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

# Bio-Technologies

In relation to the high level of differential extrapolations required. In order to generate cellular based targeting therapies, based upon these equations. Including the overall development time of related technologies. The rate is to be set, at a minimum. In order to establish a channel of viability, and is applied to the first year of product distribution.

# Industries :

There are an array of applications and economic areas, to which these tools can be applied. Namely fields such as ; 

* Advertising
* Marketing 
* Financial

With this in mind it becomes an important facet to retain the core logic of these equations, as open. In order to assist in the proliferation of ideas. Nevertheless in this memorandum of understanding. And as the world is littered with twats, all services which are rendered to provide tailored solutions, i.e derivative works based upon these equations. Will be published, inclusive of a detailed summary of delivery. Which inturn becomes a public record and therefore reference of all core logic assigned to that particular project. This structure is created in order to lower the threshold and mitigate against IP or data theft. And that is all. 

All corporate and commercial framing of products or works, derived from these equations. Will require a NDA agreement and a secure development environment, when related to the inclusion of web technologies. And this implies the transmission of information.
