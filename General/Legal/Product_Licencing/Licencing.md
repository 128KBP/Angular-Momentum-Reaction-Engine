# Standard User Licencing

All formulas which are available via github are available to download within XLS format, and within the binds of the {Non-Commercial Licence} are free of charge. 
This enables users to explore the root equations without restriction, when assessing viability in applied projects.

##### Pricing Guidance ;

In order to simplify the costing structures for commercial licences. An outline is given ; 

* Base Percent : (%) Applied rate is designated, to the currency of the end user.
* Regular Retail Price : (RRP) Licencing fees are applied as a percent of product RRP

---

Within the folders ;

* Unit Functions
* General 

Applicable rates are 0.25%. 
Which is applied to both commercial RRP, and grouped licencing structures.

* Currency
* Electrical_Resistance
* Infinities
* Lambda_Sequencer_In_Multiplication.
* The_Sulawesi_Equation : Skeleton Key

# Web Technologies

The compilation of equations into a designated programming language does not carry a licence surcharge. In order to allow for the testing and development of software and applications. The surcharge becomes applied upon product publishing, marketing or sale. For an updated list of applicable languages : [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

# Bio-Technologies

In relation to the high level of differential extrapolations required. In order to generate cellular based targeting therapies, based upon these equations. Including the overall development time of related technologies. The rate is to be set, at a minimum. In order to establish a channel of viability, and is applied to the first year of product distribution.

# Industries :

There are an array of applications and economic areas, to which these tools can be applied. Namely fields such as ; 

* Advertising
* Marketing 
* Financial

With this in mind it becomes an important facet to retain the core logic of these equations, as open. In order to assist in the proliferation of ideas. Nevertheless in this memorandum of understanding. The web is a world littered with twats. Derivative works based upon these equations , will be published. In order to create a public record of reference and core logic. This structure is created in order to lower the threshold and mitigate against IP or data theft. And that is all. 

All commercial works derived from these equations. Due to the above constraints, NDA agreements are unassignable.
