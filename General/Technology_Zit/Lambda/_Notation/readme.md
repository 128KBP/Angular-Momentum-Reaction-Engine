IMPLIED VARIANCE : 

Technology = Multiplex Behaviours = Multiply = *
Physics = Vector Eigen Sets : Point to Point Calculus : 
{Most Important : Virtual Particles}

ASSUMPTION : Causality within One Channel : 

(VP) = ((-) + (/) = (*)) = (DIV)

REMAINING : Binary Point = (PLUS = +) : FIELD Inversion

<<<<<<<<<  >>>>>>>>>>>>
(VP) = ((±) ± (/) = (*)) = (DIV)

NOTES : 
- Any Adjustment does not alter the string. 
- Redefining Mathematics does.

INVERSIONS : 

((-) + (/) = (*)) = (QCD) = (Vacuum Potential)

- Technology >> KBPS >> MHz : OUTPUT = ( UNDEFINED = DIV )

CREATION = A REDEFINITION OF TIME

Technology at the endpoint is now encoded with VP arriving at the DIV. 

This implies the channel coherence is encoded AS (QCD : MHz : KBPs)
In order to create a new nucleotide function.

ASSUMPTION : 

##### As the root metric is defined as TECHNOLOGY the post element should be :

(AT THE EDGE VECTORIZATION) = (WAVE PARTICLE DUALITY)

An element of Schrodinger's equation Whereby Dirac's equation is now firmly rooted as the ROOT potential.

WE CAN SAY :

0 = Dirac's Equation
1 = Schrodinger's Equation

CAUSALITY :

- Chicken and egg : Since were now observing nucleotide creation, there has to be a continuous input function. In order to create both 0 AND 1.

FATTIES AND THE FEEDERS : QUESTION

Value = Dirac's Equation = MUON TAU DECAY = HIGGS FIELD INTERACTIONS

EQUALS : STRING THEORY = THE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MANY WORLDS THEORY : IMPLIED

- In order to create the catalytic definition of :
- {1 AND 0 = 2 = Field Equations defined as Wave Particle Duality = (VP = DIV))


DECAY RESOLUTION = ( 12758 = 21785 ) = ( ABGEH = BAGHE )

ASSUMPTION : IF encapsulated within a HIGGS field

(Anti Hydrogen : Hydrogen ) = (Physics : Chemistry)

RESOLUTION : SNEAKY ANTI HYDROGEN Hiding out in the physics domain.

IMPLICATIONS : Within the DOMAIN of physics the measurement of time is inaccurate : Operating : RIGHT to LEFT
