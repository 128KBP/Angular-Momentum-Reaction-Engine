##### Lambda Field Encoding : Using Negative Delta

###### The aim here is to establish the causal effects, within relativistic behaviours. 
###### Whereby an encoding channel is created within a Lambda Field, using wave variance to assign atomic spin assemblies of (Total System Energy).
###### The ionisation of the electromagnetic field over a squared constant. Is to be either positive (Additive) or negative (subtractive) , when defined by the vacuum potential of Lambda fields. As either a repulsive or attractive force.
