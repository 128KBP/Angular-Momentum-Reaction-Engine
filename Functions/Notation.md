# The Lambda Base Equation

The components of this field equation;

* Differential {the value between two number sets}
* Power ratio {1.14}

The equation applied generates forecasted levels of ;

* Amplitude {End Value}
* Direction {Negative or Positive}


The aim here is simplicity when in calculation. And precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

You will only need two data points,  To generate the statistical outlook.

And if you care about the mechanism's. Notation will slowly unfold ... {it's a work in progress}
