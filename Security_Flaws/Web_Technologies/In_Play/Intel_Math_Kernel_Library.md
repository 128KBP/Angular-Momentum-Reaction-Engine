###### In the previous version of this kernel driver. The associated guidance and scripting examples which were detailed via Intel. Gave no reference to the root equations being  labelled as 'eigenvalues'. 

##### It's important to distinguish 'Intel' against the 'IP holder or developer', of this product. We should see them as seperate entities.   

######  The recent updating for {Angular Momentum}. is seemingly coinciding with parts of the Intel_Maths_Library. I'm still not sure why or how, at this stage. The labelling of the maths functions as 'eigenvalues' was recent. Prior to this , it's simply a non-descript aspect of the research. A logical conclusion, i'm aware it is this. So continue. The original base logic for Angular Momentum, without notation or labelling was :


##### (differential * 1.14^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.14^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}


###### On a laptop, and generally 'OFFLINE' as a rule of thumb. The recent updating of aspects within Angular Momentum. Sought to resolve multi-variable into a single calculation. Describing particular functions i.e : (differential * 1.14^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.14^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2} When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}. In notation as 'eigenvalues'. 
###### It's here within that development curve that I begin to draw conclusion. That there is an inherent leaking of information, which has become systemic. No longer does the work look similar in (output), but in accord with the preceeding updates and translations surrounding Intels math library. The probabability is simply too high, to coincide with the updates on the operater logic for {Angular Momentum}. It does appear the extrapolations, which have been generated with that renewed understanding, (That these are Eigenvalues). Has multipled Intels development for the 'maths library'. Today, derivative works appear to have been developed and integrated within Intel, within a matter of months.

##### Algorithm : 

##### Angular Momentum : Root Equation : (differential * 1.14^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.14^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}
###### The first iteration of this equation creates a Multi variable output. Statistically the result will project a highly accurate outcome, and on average complete at 100%. And therefore 1. Now an issue lay within the field definitions, as over time a negative accumulation of matrices or variables would arise. As an observer this would be akin to a multiple set of answers to one question, which are delivered over time. And as an 'observer' you must decide which one is correct. A major flaw in the output, within the frame of usability.

##### Intel : Root Equation : (differential * 1.13^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.13^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2} 

##### {Be aware the precise equation currently in use, is unconfirmed. Only in view of the outputs in C#, Fortran do I discern this to be the equation set in use.}

###### In the integration via Intel. A modified version of the Operator Logic is used to create parallel calculations, based on the concept of a multi variable output. The integration is translated to the programming language, Fortran and C#. And in similarity to the original equation ( Operator Logic : Root Equation : (differential * 1.14^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.14^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}, is unable to discern and describe the statement of an end singular logic. So instead it is used to create fractional units of energy which are distributed to a spectrum of co-ordinates. Therefore within that statement energy is divided. Until one calculation is equal to 1. And therefore ON.

##### Example Scripts :  
###### In this example via Intel. You are unable to see the 'Operator Logic' and therefore the 'Root Equation'. The 'Root Equation' is encoded within the Kernel driver. And the programming language 'Fortran or C#', will simply be an end output. It becomes important to understand that multiple derivative works at this stage, have been created. But all or most will rely, and therefore incorporate the 'root equation'. In order to function the Fortran & C# translations for software and application purposes. 

##### The IP registration details have been requested, in order to distinguish IP holder and 'Operator Logic'('Root Kernal Equation') Which have been integrated.
