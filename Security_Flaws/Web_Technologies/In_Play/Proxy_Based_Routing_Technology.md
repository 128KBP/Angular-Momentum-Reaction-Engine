## Proxy Based Routing Technology 

#### Key Information : 

- Handles and directs web traffic
- Vulnerability : Data Scraping & other relational purposes
- Location : Deployed globally
- Target technology : Networking Infrastructure
- Algorithm or Software package which is contracted as part of a service.

#### Observable Outcome : 

* Multi-Variable : Residential areas : [Fixed Line Networks](https://luminati.io/proxy-types/rotating-residential-ips)
* Single Variable : Device : [Mobile Networks](https://luminati.io/proxy-types/mobile-residential-ips) 
* Single to Multi : Multi to Single Distribution : [Distributed Network Transactions](https://luminati.io/locations) 

This technology should not be possible. On large scales, as is seen here. 
The required proxy configurations to circumvent web traffic for an entire area. Would bypass governing law and require intergration within grounded infrastructure. Celltowers , Cable boxes etc. In order to enable 'Data syphoning & Packet Sniffing' in this fashion.

#### Impacting & Delivering : 

- A machine address {the location of your device} 
- IP traffic or web cookie information. In order to enable a specific device to receive specific information, when combined with secondary technologies.

###### Hypothetically we can now create a control group, based on local user interaction. And when measured by web traffic to particular sites. Begin serving premodified content, to target both the group and individual. 
#### These examples are absurd. But should assist in conceptual understanding.

#### Abstraction :

This misconfiguration of web traffic, routing technology. Implies the installation is deployed as part of an algorithm and packaged within a SAAS operation {software as a service}. It flies in the face of consumer data protection in all countries. Preliminary investigation will lead to a view that 'the technology itself simply requires 'patching', in order to close the vulnerability loophole.  Though as a personal note, the awarding of contracts between 'private enterprise, technology partners and governments '. Should be a key area, to question against.

#### Resolution : A partial rebuild of the I.T & Educational sector.

Requiring all key deliverables to be brought under governmental control, and therefore the people. With no awarding of contracts or intersection of technologies by private enterprise.  All countries could share in the development and integration of these technologies, and when distributed among government networks. Such as 'Universities'. System vulnerabilities such as this one, can be remediated, resolved and redistributed far sooner.
