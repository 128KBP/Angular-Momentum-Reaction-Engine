#### Any Given Logic :
##### In this example the data used based upon currency data. I've used this as, financial data is one of the most continuous types. With a scale down to the second.

The name 'Any given logic', simply implies that any dataset with a continuous form {It does not need to be 'to the second'} can be incorporated, and use the same methodology of forecast and navigation technique.
