# Unit Functions are statistical modelling tools for data.

Data Tools' are available within both Googlesheet and XLS format. 

# Lambda_Sequencer_in_Multiplication : Base Equation 

Using the 'Nuclear Ratio' and therefore 'Base Power Ratio (^1.14)' 
Which is cross referenced within the following folder 

* Infinties 

The aim here is simplicity when in calculation, and a more precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

You will require two values in order to calculate both :

* Amplitude
* Direction 

The 'Base Power Ratio (^1.14). Can also be incorporated into other statistical toolsets provided :


# Boundary Momentum_Suquencer_In_Divsion : Unit_(Sequencing_Alternate_Divisional_Complex)

Deceptive in name, the toolset infers growth in division of an arbitrary SUM_VALUE_OF_ENERGY, 
between three equal ratio's. And will as long as {DECIMILISATION} remains intact, much like a plant continue to refresh. 

This becomes therefore an important cross referecing tool. 
When handling higher VALUES_OF_ENERGY , as this is often the area which becomes De-Decimalised.

# Unit_(AC)_Deposition_within_Decimalisation
