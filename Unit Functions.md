# Unit Functions are statistical modelling tools for data.

Data Tools' are available within both Googlesheet and XLS format. 

# Lambda_Sequencer_in_Multiplication : Base Equation 

Using the nuclear resonance and therefore 'Base power ratio (^1.14)' 
Which is cross referenced within the following folder 

* Infinties 

The aim here is simplicity when in calculation, and a stronger line of precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

In order to obtain the first the differential, to enact Lambda. You will require two values. The calculation sheet will project both 

* Amplitude
* Direction 

The resonant cycle {'Base power ratio (^1.14)'} Can also be incorporated into all other toolsets provided


# Toolset {Boundary Momentum_Suquencer_In_Divsion}.

Deceptive in name, the toolset infers growth in division of an arbitrary SUM_VALUE_OF_ENERGY, between three equal ratio's.
And will as long as {DECIMILISATION} remains intact, much like a plant continue to refresh. 

This becomes therefore an important cross referecing tool. When handling higher VALUES_OF_ENERGY this is often the area which becomes De-Decimilised.
