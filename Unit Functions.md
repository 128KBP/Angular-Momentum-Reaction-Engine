# Unit Functions are statistical modelling tools for data.

Data Tools' are available within both Googlesheet and XLS format. 

# Lambda_Sequencer_in_Multiplication : Base Equation 

Using the nuclear resonance and therefore 'Base power ratio (^1.14)' 
Which is cross referenced within the following folder 

* Infinties 

The resonant cycle can be incorporated into the toolset {Boundary Momentum_Suquencer_In_Divsion}.

The aim is simplicity when in calculation, and precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

In order to obtain the differential, to enact Lambda. You will require two values. The calculation sheet will project both 

* Amplitude
* Direction
