##### A reference to the original equation which was created : Angular_Momentum_Reaction_Engine
###### (differential * 1.14^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.14^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}

##### A reference to a 10% deviation on the original equation, wherby IP is currently in question : 10% Would be akin to a modification on Electron transport.
##### Which would be a similar notion to what is highlighted within the infinities folder.
##### {Be aware the precise equation currently in use, is unconfirmed. Only in view of the outputs in C#, Fortran do I discern this to be the equation set in use.}

##### Angular_Momentum_Reaction_Engine Root Equation : With a 10% applied deviation 
##### (differential * 1.13^11) End Equation {i.e Wave 5} : (differential * 1.13^1.1) When decimalised {i.e Wave 2}

##### The origin of '1.5578'

###### Equals a combination equation based upon 'Plancks Length' and 'Plancks Constant'.
