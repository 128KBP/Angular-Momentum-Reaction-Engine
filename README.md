# Angular Momentum When im not doing this ... I love wanking
Depicts the boundary of momentum for any energy related input. Defined within a framework of ‘ single variable calculus’. And charted to visualise the mapping of coordinates.

# Functions : Lambda Analysis
Describes the projected vector for any energy related input. And uses ‘multivariable calculus’, to determine a ‘reaction complex’ Which describes the potential towards ‘Single variable calculus’.

NB :

Wave function instabilities arise within Lambda at wave 6, due to energetic inversions. Also known as the compounding of relativistic effects. So all statistical probabilities surrounding Lambda analysis should be recalibrated, thereafter. A non-deformed wave function should zero out wave 6, when analysis is being re-calibrated.
