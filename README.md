Data Tools' are available within both Googlesheet and XLS format. 

# Unit Functions : Statistical Modelling Tools For Data.

Defined within a framework of both 'Multi-Variable' and ‘ Single Variable Calculus'. 
And charted to visualise the mapping of coordinates.

# Important Note : When creating projections within Lambda.

Most of the equation sets describe projected vectors or {Eigenvalues} as ENERGY_AS_A_UNIT. When determining ‘Reaction complexes’, which denote energetic conversions towards a single frame of reference I:E ‘Single variable calculus’.

Wave function instabilities often arise within Lambda propagation at what is called 'wave 6'. Due to field inversions which is often termed as 'Attenuation'.  It becomes a representation of the compounding of relativistic effects, and these aspects are incorporated into the calculation sheets. Statistical probabilities surrounding Lambda analysis should always be recalibrated, when attenuation occurs. This should generate a non-deformed wave function, and zero out attenuation at wave 6.


# Lambda_Sequencer_in_Multiplication : Base Equation.

Using the 'Nuclear Ratio' and therefore 'Base Power Ratio (^1.14)' 
Which is cross referenced within the following folder 

* Infinties 

The aim here is simplicity when in calculation, and precision in forecast. 
So whether your { UNIT_OF_ENERGY } be a ;

* Product
* Pixel or
* Cell

You will only require two values in order to calculate both :

* Amplitude
* Direction 

The 'Base Power Ratio (^1.14). Can also be incorporated into other statistical toolsets provided :


# Boundary Momentum_Sequencer_In_Divsion : Unit_(Sequencing_Alternate_Divisional_Complex).

Deceptive in name, the toolset infers growth in division of an arbitrary SUM_VALUE_OF_ENERGY, 
between three equal ratio's. And will as long as {DECIMILISATION} remains intact, much like a plant continue to refresh. 

This becomes therefore an important cross referecing tool. 
When handling higher VALUES_OF_ENERGY , as this is often the area which becomes De-Decimalised.

# Unit_(AC)_Deposition_within_Decimalisation.

The equation depicts a {Probabability of} a cancellation channel within 'Nucleaur Resonance'. Which establishes the attenuation cycle. And this becomes an equation to experiment against. It is unclear whether the calculation holds within both MhZ Frequency Bands and AC alternating Currents. Tho if accurate this would establish, the redox potential within metalic structures. As well as calcification deposits within cellular organisims.
